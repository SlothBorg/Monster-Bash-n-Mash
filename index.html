          <p>Er... no not a <em>Mash</em> a <em>Bash</em>!</p>
          <p>So in 2020 a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtsRCYEE-hCPsftezm9wzA" class="hidden-link">YouTuber</a> Sherdyl && I like, got some of his friends together and they each created a few cards depicting monster parts.</p>
          <p>Once the deck of these cards was compiled they each picked some number of cards and use those cards as inspiration for making Monsters!</p>
          <p>
            You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpKszuooLrCV6ZTanZ5Xiw-9vZUn8PGFE">Monster Bash I</a>, || <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCIF0esycc&list=PLiWIXKdHWWrttB8sTsHdc3ClLe0A5pMRz">Monster Bash II</a> for inspiration
            Also the deck of monster parts from Monster Bash II is available <a href="https://www.miscast.co/rpg/monsterbash">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>We will be deviating from the format shown in the videos in a number of ways, that will be explained later.</p>

        <section class="pl pr">
          <p><strong>Because both making things and Monsters are cool! Next question!</strong></p>
          <p>As you may know Sherdyl is an artistic and creative kind of fellow, and he has long enjoyed RPGs. So to honor his entrance into his fourth decade, let us <a href="https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/" class="hidden-link">cellebrite</a> by by doing some of the things he so enjoys. Again monsters are cool!</p>

        <summary class="big-summary">The Plan</summary>
        <section class="bb pl pr">
          <p>The basic plan has four phases</p>
          <p><emphasis>Create inspiration cards:</emphasis></p>
          <p>I invite you all to get some paper, and draw an image, or write down a word/phrase to serve as inspiration, these can be silly, strange, scary, sexy, or some other word starting with s.</p>
          <p>For example: pictures of, bones, horns, scales, a tail, a mouth etc. or perhaps words/phrases like. Bone, Gnarly, bulbous, oozing, shimmering, pulsating pustules.</p>
          <p>Ideally this part would be completed before the party weekend, that way I can make a virtual deck of the cars for those not able to attend.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bb pl pr">
          <p><emphasis>Drawing Cars:</emphasis> aka determining your fate</p>
          <p>Each person draws some number, that number will be decide as a group, though you are welcome to draw more cards! Each card can be interpreted how ever you see fit.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bb pl pr">
          <p><emphasis>MAKE MONSTERS:</emphasis> aka The Really Fun Part!</p>
          <p>Using the cards you drew, make something!, It could be a sculpture, a miniature, a mosaic, collage, painting, poem, a program, website a short story or what ever else you feel moved to create!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bb pl pr">
          <p><emphasis>Show and Tell:</emphasis></p>
          <p>Share what you made, take pictures of it, talk about it, etc.</p>

                <li>It is End to End encrypted, meaning they can't read what you say, the NSA can't, the FBI can't, and those last two are kinda pissed about it.</li>
                <li>They run and maintain a network of censorship resistant proxies, for folks living under authoritarian regimes.</li>
                <li>They maybe kinda, developed and weaponized an exploit against a tool that police use to illegally search your phone! - <a href="https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/">source</a></li>
