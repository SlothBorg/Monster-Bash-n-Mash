        <summary>What?</summary>
        <blockquote class="center"><em>The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash</em></blockquote>
        <p>Er... no not a <em>Mash</em> a <em>Bash</em>!</p>
        <p>So in 2020 a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtsRCYEE-hCPsftezm9wzA" class="hidden-link">YouTuber</a> Sherdyl && I like, got some of his friends together and they each created a few cards depicting monster parts.</p>
        <p>Once the deck of these cards was compiled they each picked some number of cards and use those cards as inspiration for making Monsters!</p>
        <p>
          You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpKszuooLrCV6ZTanZ5Xiw-9vZUn8PGFE">Monster Bash I</a>, || <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCIF0esycc&list=PLiWIXKdHWWrttB8sTsHdc3ClLe0A5pMRz">Monster Bash II</a> for inspiration
          Also the deck of monster parts from Monster Bash II is available <a href="https://www.miscast.co/rpg/monsterbash">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We will be deviating from the format shown in the videos in a number of ways, that will be explained later.</p>

        <summary>Why?</summary>
        <p><strong>Because both making things and Monsters are cool! Next question!</strong></p>

        <summary>How?</a> aka <em>The Plan</em></summary>
        <p>The basic plan has four phases</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Create inspiration cards:</strong></p>
            <p>I invite you all to get some paper, and draw an image, or write down a word/phrase to serve as inspiration, these can be silly, strange, scary, sexy, or some other word starting with s.</p>
            <p>For example: pictures of, bones, horns, scales, a tail, a mouth etc. or perhaps words/phrases like. Bone, Gnarly, bulbous, oozing, shimmering, pulsating pustules.</p>
            <p>Ideally this part would be completed before the party weekend, that way I can make a virtual deck of the cars for those not able to attend.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Drawing Cars:</strong> aka determining your fate</p>
            <p>Each person draws some number, that number will be decide as a group, though you are welcome to draw more cards! Each card can be interpreted how ever you see fit.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>MAKE MONSTERS:</strong> aka The Really Fun Part!</p>
            <p>Using the cards you drew, make something!, It could be a sculpture, a miniature, a mosaic, collage, painting, poem, a program, website a short story or what ever else you feel moved to create!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong></p>
            <p>Share what you made, take pictures of it, talk about it, etc.</p>
           </li>
        </ol>

        <summary>Virtual Participation</summary>
        <p>There is a <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKINpiK5TFGE5KmaZs_3zGo1fA5TLqA3tDV2h2S9DESxC5EhAvMUCNDphvfcw_a5L2ITBW">Signal group</a>.
          <aside>If you're not using signal, allow me to climb atop my <strong><em>CyberSecurity && Privacy Soapbox&trade;</em></strong> and preach to you for a moment, go install <a href="https://www.signal.org/">signal</a>.
            Here are Four examples of how awesome Signal is!
            <ol start="0">
              <li>It is End to End encrypted, meaning they can't read what you say, the NSA can't, the FBI can't, and those last two are kinda pissed about it.</li>
              <li>They run and maintain a network of censorship resistant proxies, for folks living under authoritarian regimes.</li>
              <li>They maybe kinda, developed and weaponized an exploit against a tool that police use to illegally search your phone! - <a href="https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/">source</a></li>
              <li>The subverted DRM technology, to implement state of the art security and privacy for sharing contacts! - <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">source</a></li>
              <li>When subpoenaed, the only data they could provide was a time stamp of when an account was created and the last time it has connected to a Signal server - <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/"></a></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Sorry Sherdyl, I couldn't help myself!</strong></p>
          </aside>
        </p>
        <p>There is also a <a href="https://meet.google.com/egc-ubcn-wdp">Google Meet</a>, meeting that I'll have open when people are crafting, so you can join in on the fun, we'll also plan some kind of show and tell!</p>
